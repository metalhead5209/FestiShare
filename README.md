Have you ever been to a music festival? At one point in my life, they were all I lived for. Over the last few years I've slowed down a lot but I still love to go; jsut not as often. FestiShare is a place where you can share that experience. Maybe you're contemplating on whether to go to this festival and don't quite know anyone who has attended. FestiShare is here to solve that problem. Anyone can visit the site and check out any of the festivals and their reviews that have been added by other users. To add festivals and leave reviews, you must register for an account and be logged in. No need to use actual emails or passwords. As long as the email is in email format (@somemail.com) it will validate. Each festival is geo located with a convienent map for visual preference. 

Please Visit and leave reviews!!

Enjoy!
